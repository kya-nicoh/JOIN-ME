# JOIN-ME
WARNING. THIS IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL AND IN ALPHA STAGES. This is a simple project I did where our professor challenged us that who ever enters the class first gets extra credit. So I created a bot that lets me join the meeting automatically.

## Features
- Whenever someone creates a meeting a notification pops up. The code scans the screen for the join button then clicks it.
